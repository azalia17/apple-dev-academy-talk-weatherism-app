Project Overview
=================
This feature provides users with clothing and item recommendations based on the current weather condition and temperature. It enhances user value by offering personalized and practical advice for everyday weather scenarios, improving usability and engagement.

Requirements
=================
**Functional Requirements**
- Should return a list of items to wear or bring, based on `weatherCode` and `temperature2m`.
- Items must include SF Symbols icons.
- Items should appear in a grid-style section called “What to Bring”.
- Section should be visible only when valid weather data is available.

**Non-Functional Requirements**
- Should not noticeably impact initial app load time.
- Maintain 60 FPS on latest iPhone devices.
- No additional API calls or backend dependencies.
