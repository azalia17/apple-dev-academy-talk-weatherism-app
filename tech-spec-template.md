Project Overview
=================
This feature provides users with clothing and item recommendations based on the current weather condition and temperature. It enhances user value by offering personalized and practical advice for everyday weather scenarios, improving usability and engagement.

Requirements
=================
**Functional Requirements**
- Should return a list of items to wear or bring, based on `weatherCode` and `temperature2m`.
- Items must include SF Symbols icons.
- Items should appear in a grid-style section called “What to Bring”.
- Section should be visible only when valid weather data is available.

**Non-Functional Requirements**
- Should not noticeably impact initial app load time.
- Maintain 60 FPS on latest iPhone devices.
- No additional API calls or backend dependencies.

# Low-Level Diagram

```
View: WeatherView.swift
 ├── WeatherViewModel
 │     └── recommendedItems(for:temperature:)
 │             └── returns [RecommendationItem]
 └── UI renders LazyVGrid for What to Bring section

Data: WeatherResponse
 └── current.weatherCode
 └── current.temperature2m

```

# Code Structure & Implementation Details

- Add `RecommendationItem` struct with `name` and `icon` (UUID, SF Symbol).
- Implement `recommendedItems(for:temperature:)` in `WeatherViewModel`.
- Use `LazyVGrid` in `WeatherView` to render items with `Image(systemName:)` and `Text`.

```swift
struct RecommendationItem: Identifiable {
    let id = UUID()
    let name: String
    let icon: String
}

```

```swift
func recommendedItems(for weatherCode: Int, temperature: Double?) -> [RecommendationItem] {
    // Logic using weatherCode and temperature to return relevant items with icons
}

```

# Operational Excellence

- No backend or service dependencies
- Visual verification in UI
- Datadog custom event logging for weather item usage to be considered in v2

# Backward Compatibility / Rollback Plan

- Feature is self-contained in FE; rollback involves removing the LazyVGrid block
- Wrapped behind UI conditional (`if let weather = ...`)
- Can be disabled via feature flag in future if needed

# Rollout Plan

- Full rollout to all users in next app release
- Can be toggled via feature flag if implemented later

# Out of scope

- Localization of recommended item text
- Dynamic recommendation updates (e.g., UV Index, pollen)
- Backend-driven item lists

# Steps to use this feature

1. Launch the Weatherism app.
2. Enter or allow location to fetch weather data.
3. Scroll down to the “What to Bring” section.
4. View recommended items based on current weather and temperature.

# Discussions and Alignments

Q: Should we support additional weather parameters like UV Index or Air Quality?

A: Not for now. Keep v1 lightweight and based on existing data.

Q: Will we support localization in future?

A: It’s in roadmap after multi-region support is rolled out.
